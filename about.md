# _Why Starting a Blog_?
---
My motivation for starting this blog, in part, comes from this Confucious quote:  
> 温故而知新，可以为师矣。

Here is how I translated it:
> Through reviewing, one can gain new insights and be able to teach.

As I'm wrapping up with my undergraduate career, I've realized that the importance of reviewing lies not only in the prospect of gaining _new insights_, but to retain "_old insights_". I've learned over and over again that the effect of the _[forgetting curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve "Forgetting Curve")_ is too punishing to be ignored for the common minds.

So, this _blog/website_ is my effort to recall, reinforce, and remember what I have learned in hopes of gaining new insights. As someone who dabbles in **computer science**, **physics**, and **maths**, most of the content on this website will be related to these three topics, with physics being the most predominant.

Aside from reviewing being a good way to reinforce learning, the act of writing also provokes thinking and helps one understand. This is another reason that I am starting this blog: _to exercise my writing and presentation skills_.

The final small motivation I have for starting this blog is to have a bit of an _online presence_ (it's the 21st century afterall ;). There are so many platforms out there today for people to have such an online presence, but I feel uneasy about the proprietory nature of these platforms and the users' lack of control. That's why I'm starting this blog using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (free hosting) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (no need for database!). 


That's it. Thanks for reading my rumbling! Checkout the **Blog** tab above to see what's rolling!
